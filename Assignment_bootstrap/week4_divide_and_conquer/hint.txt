Number of inversions is a variant extension of merge sort by divide-and-conquer strategy.
The hint is to discover the process of comparison, between two head elemnets from two subarrays, during merge stage.
Once we get the insight of the relationship between inversion and comparison, 
we can easily modify and enhance merge sort to calculate the number of inersions of a given sequence.

Points over segments (i.e., organizing a lottery) is a variant extension of quick sort by divide-and-conquer strategy.
The hint is to decompose each segment as a combination of two points, one is left end point, the other is right end point.

Therefore, we have three kinds of points:
The first one is left end point, with coordination and a label "S_LEFT"
The second one is the given point, with coordication and a label "P_POINT"
The third one is the right end point, with coordination and a label "S_RIGHT"

Next, conducting a sorting over those points, 
and it is clear that the number of covering segment equals to the number of enclosure by S_LEFT and S_RIGHT.

For example:

Seg 1 4
Seg 2 5
Point 3

decomposition
-------------->

(1, S_LEFT)
(4, S_RIGHT)
(2, S_LEFT)
(5, S_RIGHT)
(3, P_POINT)

sorting
-------------->

(1, S_LEFT), (2, S_LEFT), (3, P_POINT), (4, S_RIGHT), (5, S_RIGHT)

get covering
-------------->

(3, P_POINT)'s segment covering is 2, with Seg 1 4 and Seg 2 5.

assignment in week 1 is just a warm up for us to get familiar with the usage of submission and judge system in coursera.

It is clear and easy for us to follow the instruction and guideline in pdf file to pass all those 2 problem set.

1. Sum of two digits.

Use a + b and print statement to output the result



2. Maximum pairwise product

Use the property max( a * b ) = max(a) * max (b)

Catch the idea above and use it to find the first two largest element from input array.
Then, we can get the maximum pairwise product by taking a multiplication of a * b.
